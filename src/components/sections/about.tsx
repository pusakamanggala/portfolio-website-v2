          I’m a passionate Front-End Developer with a knack for crafting
          seamless, user-friendly digital experiences. Every pixel, interaction,
          and line of code is an opportunity to solve problems with clarity and
          creativity—whether I’m building dynamic interfaces or fine-tuning
          performance for real-world users.

          I work at{" "}
          <strong className="text-white">Awan Dinata Teknologi</strong> as a
          Front-End Developer, translating design visions into functional,
          performant web applications. My day-to-day involves close
          collaboration with designers to refine UI/UX, pairing with backend
          teams to integrate APIs, and iterating based on user feedback—all
          while keeping code maintainable and scalable.

          brand has taught me how to merge technical precision with fan-centric
          creativity—ensuring every pixel aligns with the team’s spirit and
          audience expectations.
