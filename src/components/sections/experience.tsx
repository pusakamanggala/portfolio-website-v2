              Developed a comprehensive application system for Eka Jaya Berindo
              to streamline driving lesson appointments, accompanied by a CMS
              dashboard for efficient data and activity management. The system
              facilitates seamless coordination between students, instructors,
              and administrators, ensuring a structured and user-friendly
              experience. For instructors, the app provides functionalities to
              view assigned classes (appointments), manage car availability, and
              report incidents during lessons. Students can check their
              appointment schedules, submit feedback, track their driving lesson
              progress, and purchase lesson packages. Meanwhile, administrators
              have full control over managing student and instructor profiles,
              scheduling classes, overseeing car allocations, and handling
              driving lesson packages.
